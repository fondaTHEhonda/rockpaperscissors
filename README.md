Goal: Follow guidelines for Odin Project's first step in creating rock, paper, scissors program. Overall, this went pretty smoothly. A few hiccups along the way including a syntax error with the for loop and not returning the value of the computerPlay function. The biggest struggle was the computerSelection parameter. I was thrown off in the instructions because it simply said computerSelection = computerPlay();. However, that caused the computerSelection to be equal to the first time computerPlay() was called and the all rounds of the game were the same. I researched what was causing this but wasn't able to find a solution. I ended up reviewing some of the completed projects since I had everything except this one part completed and realized that the variable should have been defined locally in the game() function.
